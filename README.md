# [CharityQ](https://tagg-uno.herokuapp.com/)

### Executive Summary

Together Achieve Greater Good (TAGG) created an application for businesses to streamline the donation request process for small and large businesses.  When individuals purchase goods and services from a participating business and then share them on social media a donation is made. To take the TAGG application a step further, the TAGG team dreamed of an additional service named CharityQ that could allow the businesses to easily process the donation requests being generated.  This would free the decision makers and business owners to focus more on the business and still support the community by providing donations.
